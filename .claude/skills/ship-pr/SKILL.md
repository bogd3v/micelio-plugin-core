description: Gate 5 of the Micelio factory - after the maintainer's approval, commit with sign-off (or push the commit the maintainer made), open the pull request and watch CI. Used by the master when a change has passed the blind review and the verification, or when asked to open, update or rebase a pull request.

# Ship a PR

This is gate 5 of the factory (`docs/factory.md` of `micelio-engineering`). The standard still rules: sections 11 and 13.

## Branch

- Always from the latest `main`: `git fetch origin && git switch -c <type>/<short-topic> origin/main`. Never commit on `main`, and never stack on another open branch unless the change depends on it.
- One concern per pull request. Security fixes, refactors, docs and dependency updates travel separately.

## Before the maintainer

Gate 5 starts only after gates 2, 3 and 4 passed. Nothing is committed before it.

1. `npm run check` is green and the pull request draft has the real output of every command.
2. The correction log is complete. List the `Gate 3` and `Gate 4` comments and the `factory-log |` lines of the issue (`gh issue view <n> --json comments --jq '.comments[] | select(.body | test("^(\\*\\*Gate [34]|factory-log \\|)")) | .body'`, never the full list). If any of them names a Blocking, an Important or a mismatch and the issue has no comment with a `factory-log |` line, stop: say which correction (which gate comment) has no line, and let the master post it. `ship-pr` never writes the line itself: it is the master's job at the moment of the correction (`docs/factory.md`, "The learning loop").
3. Canary. A pull request that changes a file of `.github/standard-sync.json`, `herdr/master.md`, `.claude/TEAM.md` (models) or the sections of the standard a role reads is opened only with a green canary run on the branch (`fixtures/factory/RUN.md`, "Canary" of `micelio-engineering`), cited in the draft's Tests section with its three results: the reviewer's Blocking found, the verifier's mismatch found, the escalation on round 3. Without it, stop and say so; the master runs the canary.
4. Tell the maintainer the change is ready and what only they can see on Docker (below). Then wait.
5. The commit message is a file outside the worktree, written by the worker. The worker never commits or pushes; the master runs this skill.
6. The sign-off is the maintainer's certification of the DCO (standard, section 13), given after they read the diff. The rule is written once, in `.claude/agents/master.md` ("Delivery"): only the master runs `git commit -s`, and only on the maintainer's exact phrase.

## Docker by risk

- The worker proved the acceptance criteria on the repository's Docker (or the run `AGENTS.md` names instead), and the verifier re-created it from scratch. Cite both runs in the pull request.
- The maintainer tests on Docker only what an operator or an editor sees: the admin UI, variables, migrations, Compose. Give the steps (image from the branch, the Compose to run it against, what to look at) for those and for nothing else.
- A change nobody sees that way (tooling, documents, a library) needs no maintainer Docker run.

## Commit

- Message: English, conventional prefix with an optional scope (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `style`, `test`, `ci`, `perf`, `chore`; `chore(deps)` for dependencies, scope `security` for security fixes). The subject is imperative, about 72 characters; the body gives the problem, then what changed, then what the reviewer must know. End with `Co-Authored-By: <the tool> <noreply@anthropic.com>` as the session gives it.
- Stage explicit paths (`git add <paths>`); never `git add -A` blindly (scratch files, `.playwright-mcp/`, a local `.env`).
- The maintainer reads the whole diff (standard, section 11). Then, after the phrase (step 6), the master runs only the commit prepared from the message file; if the maintainer runs it instead, it is the same command:

  ```bash
  git add <paths>
  git commit -s -F <message file>
  ```

  A commit that lacks its `Signed-off-by` is fixed by the maintainer, never by an agent. Never amend or force-push a commit that was signed off.

## Push and open the pull request

Only after the commit exists: made by the master after the phrase, or by the maintainer, who says so.

1. Check conflicts first:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git merge-tree --write-tree origin/main HEAD >/dev/null && echo ok
   ```

2. Push: `git push -u origin <branch>`. If the branch was rebased, `git push --force-with-lease=<branch>:<sha> origin <branch>` with the sha you last saw on the remote, never a bare `--force`. If `package.json` or the lockfile conflict, take both from `main`, re-add your dependency with `npm install` so npm regenerates the lock, and never hand-edit the lockfile.
3. Open the pull request with `gh pr create` (or the REST API when the account cannot use it). The title has the same conventional prefix and sets the release label (`pr-labels.yml`); the body follows `.github/pull_request_template.md`: Problem, What changes, For review, Tests with each command, its real output and the Docker used, and "Instructions that were wrong or missing". It references its issue: `Refs #N`, or `Closes #N` in the last one. End with the attribution line the session gives.
4. Update the issue's **Progress** section in the same step: the pull request, what changed with numbers, what remains. `gh issue view <n> --json body -q .body` and `gh issue edit <n> --body-file <file>`.
5. Watch CI: `gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 1`, then `gh run watch`. A red check goes back to you; never merge around it.

## The approval

The maintainer's approval carries a line `time: <minutes>m diff|report` (`diff` when they started from the diff, `report` when they started from the reviewer's and verifier's reports; `docs/factory.md`, review levels). The approval text you prepare carries it already filled in with the order read: `report` when the pull request is level 2 ("The maintainer's review levels" of `docs/factory.md`), `diff` when it is level 1; only the minutes are left to the maintainer. When the maintainer's own account opened the pull request, GitHub does not allow it to approve, so the line goes in a review comment instead:

```bash
gh pr review <n> --comment -b "time: 10m diff"
```

## Never

Run `git commit -s` without the maintainer's own `approved, sign off #N` for this issue, or as any role but the master, or with a committer identity that is not the maintainer's; add a `Signed-off-by` by hand or with `--amend`; push before the commit exists; or merge, tag, release or deploy without the maintainer's confirmation. Only the maintainer releases (standard, section 13); prepare a release, never run it unasked.
