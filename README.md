# Micelio Plugin Core

Micelio's core as a Strapi 5 plugin: sites, blocks, the editorial workflow, hooks and the host check.

## Getting started

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
```

Conventions, commands and structure are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); the rules every Micelio repository shares are in the [engineering standard](docs/engineering-standard.md). To contribute, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releases

The Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) is started by the maintainer from the Actions tab. It defaults to a dry run that prints the version and the notes. Publishing needs a `release` environment with required reviewers (Settings → Environments), and a pull request title with a conventional prefix decides the version (section 7 of the standard).
